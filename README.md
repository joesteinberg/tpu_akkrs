The repo is organized into two main folders:
- "model" contains C code that simulates a panel of exporters
- "scripts" contains Python codes that process the simulated data and perform estimations

<h2>1. Model</h2>
The C code is organized into three folders: "src," which contains the source code; "bin," which contains the executable; and "output," which contains the programs output. The main "model" folder also contains a makefile used to create the executable.
